# The Predict Blood Donations project for the MedTourEasy Data Analyst Internship.
Blood tranfusion is the common and safe medical procedure in which the healthy blood is transferred in to another person body through intravenous line.<br>
Our dataset contains the donor information taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The blood transfusion service centre collects blood every three months in one university in Hsin-Chu City. <br>
So they have selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. These 748 donor data contain features such as R (Recency - months since last donation), F (Frequency - total number of donation), M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.), T (Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood). <br>
In this project, we need to predict whether the given donor will donate blood within the time frame or not. <br>
The data is stored in datasets/transfusion.data and it is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM).
